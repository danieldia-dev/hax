## [Unreleased]

Changes to the Rust Engine:
 - Add a rejection phase for interleaving of expressions and statements not
   supported by the Lean do-notation syntax (#1739).
 - Add a phase to handle the monadic encoding: it explicitly introduces two new
   Hax primitives `pure` (to wrap values as monadic computations) and `lift` (to
   lift monadic computations into values) (#1746)
 - Add a mechanism to lookup pre- and post-conditions (#1805)

Changes to the frontend:
 - Update the pin of rustc (#1765)
 - Miscellaneous changes related to Charon (#1765)

Change to cargo-hax:

Changes to hax-lib:
 - Add Lean core models for options, results, default (#1747)
 - F* lib: improved while loops support, additions of some specific arithmetic operations and fixed `TryInto` for integer types (#1742)

Changes to the Lean backend:
 - Support for constants with arbitrary computation (#1738)
 - Add support for base-expressions of structs (#1736)
 - Use the explicit monadic phase to insert `pure` and `←` only on demand, and
   not introduce extra `do` block (#1746)
 - Rename `Result` monad to `RustM` to avoid confusion with Rust `Result` type (#1768)
 - Add support for shift-left (#1785)
 - Add support for default methods of traits (#1777)
 - Add support for floats (#1784)
 - Add support for pattern matching on constant literals (#1789)
 - Add support for binding subpatterns in match constructs (#1790)
 - Add error when using patterns in function parameters (#1792)
 - Add support for constant parameters to functions and traits (#1797)
 - Add support for associated types with equality constraints (#1806)
 - Add generation of specs from requires/ensures-annotations (#1815)

Miscellaneous:
- Reserve extraction folder for auto-generated files in Lean examples (#1754)

## 0.3.5

Changes to the Rust Engine:
 - The module `names` now produces `ExplicitDefId`s instead of `DefId`s (#1648)
 - Add a resugaring `FunctionsToConstants` (#1559)
 - Drop the tuple nodes of the AST, add resugaring node for tuples (#1662)
 - Add support for enums and structs to the Lean backend (type definitions,
   expressions, pattern-matching) (#1623)
 - Update name rendering infrastructure in the Lean backend (#1623, #1624)
 - Printers now emit proper diagnostics (PR #1669)
 - Global identifiers are now interned (#1689)
 - Global identifiers are encapsulated properly, and provide easy destructuring as tuple identifiers (#1693)
 - Add support for `trait` and `impl` in the Lean backend (#1679): trait definitions, trait bounds
   on functions, impl definitions. The typeclass resolution in the generated code is left implicit
   (relies on Lean). Limited support for associated types. No support for default implementations.
 - Refactor of the printing infrastructure: lowers the boilerplate, get rid of most lifetimes annotation, add proper contextual span support (#1735)

Changes to the frontend:
- Add an explicit `Self: Trait` clause to trait methods and consts (#1559)
- Fix `ImplExpr::Builtin` that had some type errors (#1559)
- Improve the translation of `Drop` information (#1559)
- Add variance information to type parameters (#1559)
- Cleanup the `State` infrastructure a little bit (#1559)
- Add information about the metadata to use in unsize coercions (#1559)
- Resolve `dyn Trait` predicates (#1559)
- Many improvements to `FullDef` (#1559)
- Add infrastructure to get a monomorphized `FullDef`; this is used in charon to monomorphize a crate graph (#1559)
- Fix a regression affecting projection predicates (#1678)

Change to cargo-hax:
- Improve the caching of rustc when using `cargo hax` commands (#1719)
- Add hidden commands and flags to explicitly manipulate `haxmeta` files (#1722)

Changes to hax-lib:
- New behavior for `hax_lib::include`: it now forces inclusion when in contradiction with `-i` flag.
- hax-lib requires edition 2021 instead of 2024 (#1726)
- Improved `VecDeque` model in F* proof lib (#1728)
- Split the Lean library into several files, update to lean 4.23.0 (#1696)

Changes to the Lean backend:
- Improve support for functionalized loops (#1695)
- Improve error messages, having each error (coming from the Lean backend) point to a specific github issue (#1717).

Miscellaneous:
 - A lean tutorial has been added to the hax website (#1626)
 - Add end-to-end tests for the website (#1690)
 - Diagnostics reporting were improved (#1692)
